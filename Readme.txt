HOW TO TRANSLATE AND TEST

[resource-originals] contains all the untranslated XML files,
once translated, put the translated XML file into the correct 
subfolder inside [resource], then run Pack-???.bat to generate
the translation pack.

Copy the generated pak file into the game folder and it
should be automatically loaded.

KNOWN ISSUES

Current limitation is that the packer cannot work with more
than 500 files in a single folder, so do not put any
untranslated files into the [resource] folder.

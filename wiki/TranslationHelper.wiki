= Translation Helper App =
Created by apqoo (whatisqoo)

This is a new version of the Translation Helper that can automatically process all the XML files in a folder. This is an Adobe Air application and you must download it to your computer to run it. 

=== Download ===
The App is now included in the [http://code.google.com/p/dn-translation/downloads/detail?name=DN_CN_Translation_Kit_20100826.zip Translation Kit]. Run *SVN-Update.bat* to update to the latest version.

=== Usage ===
Copy all the XML files you want to translate into the "resource-input" folder. Run run "start.bat" to start the app, then press "Start Translating!". 

=== Remarks ===
*Note 1:* Please beware that the app will automatically *delete* completed files from the input folder.

*Note 2:* Make sure you do not have any 0 byte (empty) files in the input folder. 

*Note 3:* The app is based on the original Translation Helper code, so same limitations apply. See [LargeFilesGuide] for tips on how to automate the translation of large files such as uistring.xml

*Note 4:* If the translation process stops because of an error, you can usually just click start again to resume from the last file. 

*Note 5:* Note that there is a rate limit on the translation web service. If you hit the limit, then the translation will stop. You'll need to wait a while before you can continue again.

_This file is also included in the Translation Kit_

If your browser can display the page directly, then you can just use it online. If not, right click on the link and save the page to your computer. When you open it, you need to allow any permissions it asks for.

Latest version of Firefox or Google Chrome is recommended. If using Internet Explorer, please use 8.0 or newer.

=== Usage ===
Copy and paste the contents of an XML file into the left text box ("Source"), then click on the buttons labeled "1", "2" and "3", in that order.

  # Extract: Extracts all the translatable text from source.
  # Translate: Use Google Translate AJAX API to perform translation on all extracted text.
  # Replace: Replace the source text with translated text.

On the bottom of the page, you can also do single translations by entering what you want into the box then click on "Translate This".

=== Text Extraction Methods ===
There are two methods you can choose from to extract text from the input source. Please try them both and see which produces better translations for the portions you are working on.
  * Unicode: This method extracts text using the character code range that contains most Chinese characters. Using this method, the extracted text does not contain any symbols and usually produces short phrases and text fragments. 

  * CDATA: This method extracts the contents of all CDATA tags from the source. The results are longer, more complete sentences, but also contain HTML tags. The HTML tags are sent to translation with the text.

=== Remarks ===

*Note 1:* The script will probably not able to take the entire uistring.xml (or any other large files) at once. It will probably make your computer explode if you try. So when it comes to large files, you should just copy in and process a few lines at a time.

*Note 2:* If, for some reason, the latest version is not working properly, you can find older version [http://code.google.com/p/dn-translation/source/list?path=/trunk/translation-helper/index.html here]. Please report any bugs either here on Google Code (create a new issue), or post on forums.

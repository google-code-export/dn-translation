Right click on the link and save it to your computer. When you run it, you need to allow any permissions it asks for.

Usage: Copy and paste the contents of an XML file into the left text box (Source), then click on the buttons labeled "1", "2" and "3", in that order.

  # Extract: Extracts all the translatable text from source
  # Translate: Use Google Translate AJAX API to perform translation on all extracted text
  # Replace: Replace the source text with translated text

On the bottom you can also do single translations by entering what you want into the box then click on "Translate This".

Note: The script will probably not able to take the entire uistring.xml at once, it will probably make your computer explode if you try. So when it comes to uistring.xml, you should just copy in a few lines at a time.
